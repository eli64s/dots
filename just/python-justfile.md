**How to Use This `justfile`:**

1.  **Save:** Save this content as `justfile` in the root of your Python project.
2.  **Customize `FIXME`:**
    *   Update `SRC_DIR := "src/your_package_name"` to match your project's source directory layout (e.g., `"your_package_name"` if not using a `src` layout, or the correct path if it is). This is important for test coverage.
3.  **Configure `pyproject.toml`:**
    *   Ensure you have a `[project.optional-dependencies]` section (or `[tool.uv.sources]` if you prefer that for dev tools) for your development tools. For example:
        ```toml
        [project.optional-dependencies]
        dev = [
            "ruff",
            "pytest",
            "pytest-cov",
            "mkdocs",
            "mkdocs-material", # Or your preferred MkDocs theme & plugins
            # Add other dev tools like pre-commit, ipython, etc.
        ]
        ```
    *   The `DEV_GROUP` variable in the `justfile` (`dev` by default) should match the key used here.
4.  **Install `just`:** If you haven't already, [install `just`](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).
5.  **Run Recipes:**
    *   `just init` (or `just setup`): To set up the project for the first time or after cloning.
    *   `just test`: To run tests.
    *   `just format`: To format code.
    *   `just docs`: To serve documentation.
    *   `just`: To see a list of all available recipes.
    *   `just help`: Same as `just`.

This `justfile` provides a robust set of commands for a typical modern Python workflow with `uv`. Remember to adapt paths and group names as needed for your specific project structure.
