Everything is fair game when making new syntax. If you can code it, it can be yours. This is our design philosophy to help restrict ideas:

1: Avoid invention when possible
Yes, prompts need versioning — we have a great versioning tool: git
Yes, you need to save prompts — we have a great storage tool: filesystems
2: Any file editor and any terminal should be enough to use it
3: Be fast
4: A first year university student should be able to understand it
