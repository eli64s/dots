Create a `justfile` for the project to automate common development commands.

Just is a command runner (like make but simpler). Key syntax:
- Recipes are defined as `recipe-name: dependencies`
- Commands are indented with tabs/spaces
- Variables use `{{variable}}` syntax
- Comments start with #

Project context: [brief description of your project and what commands you need automated]
