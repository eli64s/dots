## Quickstart

This guide will get you up and running with the project using `uv` as the project and package manager.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher is recommended. *(Adjust this to your project's specific Python version requirements.)* You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **uv**: The fast Python package and project manager. If you don't have it, install it using one of the methods below.
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).

**Installing `uv`:**

You can install `uv` via `curl` (macOS/Linux), `powershell` (Windows), or `pip`:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or, if you have pip installed (globally or in a managed environment)
pip install uv
```
For more installation options, see the [official `uv` installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
    cd your-project-name
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git` with the actual repository URL.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    `uv` will create a virtual environment (typically `.venv` in the project root) if one doesn't exist, and then install all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    If the project defines optional dependency groups (e.g., for development, testing, or specific features), you can install them using the `--extra` flag. For example, to install a common `dev` group:
    ```bash
    uv sync --extra dev
    ```
    *(Check the `pyproject.toml` file for available optional dependency groups, usually under `[project.optional-dependencies]` or potentially referenced in `[tool.uv.sources]`.)*

    After this step, your environment is ready. `uv` commands like `uv run` will automatically detect and use this `.venv`. If you wish to activate the virtual environment manually in your shell:
    ```bash
    # On macOS and Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows (Command Prompt)
    # .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # On Windows (PowerShell)
    # .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

### Running the Project

*(This section should be customized for your specific project. Below are common examples.)*

To run the main application (e.g., a script):
```bash
uv run python src/your_project/main.py
```
*(Replace `src/your_project/main.py` with the actual path to your project's main script.)*

To run tests (e.g., using `pytest`):
```bash
uv run pytest
```
*(Replace `pytest` with your project's test command if different.)*

### Common `uv` Commands

Here are a few `uv` commands you might find useful during development. For more details, refer to the [official `uv` documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

*   **Install/Synchronize dependencies (e.g., after pulling changes or if `uv.lock` was updated):**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    To include optional dependencies, like a `dev` group:
    ```bash
    uv sync --extra dev
    ```

*   **Add a new runtime dependency:**
    This adds the package to `[project.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`, updates `uv.lock`, and installs it.
    ```bash
    uv add <package_name>
    ```

*   **Add a new development-only dependency:**
    This adds the package to `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]` (or a similar group) in `pyproject.toml`, updates `uv.lock`, and installs it.
    ```bash
    uv add <package_name> --dev
    ```

*   **Update all dependencies to their latest allowed versions:**
    This respects constraints in `pyproject.toml`, updates `uv.lock` to the latest resolvable versions, and then installs them.
    ```bash
    uv lock --upgrade
    uv sync
    ```

*   **Upgrade a specific package to its latest version:**
    This updates its version in `pyproject.toml` (if it's a direct dependency), updates `uv.lock`, and installs the new version.
    ```bash
    uv add <package_name> --upgrade
    ```

*   **Run any command within the project's virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    uv run <command_with_args>
    ```
    Examples:
    ```bash
    uv run python --version
    uv run black .
    uv run mypy src/
    ```
